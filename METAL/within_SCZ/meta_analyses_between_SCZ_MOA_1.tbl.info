# Effect    - overall estimated effect size for allele1
# StdErr    - overall standard error for effect size estimate
# P-value   - meta-analysis p-value
# Direction - summary of effect direction for each study, with one '+' or '-' per study
# HetISq    - I^2 statistic which measures heterogeneity on scale of 0-100%
# HetChiSq  - chi-squared statistic in simple test of heterogeneity
